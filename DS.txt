

  Data structure :
                  An arrangement of data in memory.

  type of Data structure :
                 1) Linear data structure / Sequential 
                                          		Array, Stack,  Queue, Linked List

		 2) Non Linear data structure
						        Tree , graph

  Data structure we can perform operations on data

  
 1)  Allocating space dynamically for stucture

 2)  Passing of the pointer of a dynamically allocated structure to a function

 3)  Returning pointer of dynamically allocated space

 4)  Passing address of a structure to a function


 Stack : 
         pile of Items and it follows Last in First out data structure ( LIFO )

         Two operations : Push  : To add element on the stack
                          POP   : To remove element from the stack

        Components of stack ;
                                container of items (Array)
                                Top pointer  which points to top most element in the stack
       
	Any modification can be done on top only

  
  Stack implementation using Array

                                  Size of stack 

  Staxk implementation using Linked List (Linked Stack)



  Declaration of stack using structure


  struct st
  {
	int top;
	int element[5];
  }stack;

  
  functions on the stack :

  1) Initialization of stack
  2) Push operation
  3) Pop opeartion
  4) is_full check 
  5) is_empty check 

  
  Static allocation of stack in memory

                              1) create a structure variable 
			      2) Pass the address of structure variable without using malloc function

  
  Dynamic allocation of stack in memory


                              1) create a structure pointer variable 
			      2) Pass the structure pointer variable on allocating memory using malloc function

 
  Applications of Stack :
 	                      1) Reversing a string 
 			      2) during function call
                              3) Conversion of polish notation


   Polish Notation :

                    1) Infix
				operator between operands 
                                
				a+b

		    2) Prefix   (Polish notation)
				operator is before operands
				 +ab


		    3) Postfix  (Reverse Polish notation)
				operator is after operands
				ab+

			
		Ex :
		    a=2, b=3, c=4

                    a+b*c (infix) =>  a+*bc  => +a*bc (Prefix)   => +2(12) => 14

				  =>  a+bc*  => abc*+ (Postfix)  => 2+(12) => 14

                    (a+b)*c (infix) =>  +ab*c  => *+abc (Prefix)
				    => ab+*c =>  ab+c* (Postfix)

   Queue :
        Sequence of elements

	data structure follows First In First Out (FIFO) property

	Queue has 3 components : 1) Array of elements : contains the elements in a queue 
				 2) Front pointer     : represents the first element of the queue
				 3) Rear pointer      : represents the last element of the queue
         
        operation :   
			1) Enque operation : To add an element in the queue , Addition is performed on the rear end of queue
			2) Deque operation : To delete an element from the queue , Deletion is performed at front end of the queue.


        
   Declaration of the Queue :

         
                typedef struct Qe
		{
			int front;
			int rear;
			int elements[5];
		}Queue;



   functions :

   1) initialization
   2) Addition
   3) Deletion
   4) is_full
   5) is_empty

   Creating header file :

                          filename.h   ===== contains definition / prototype

   Include header file in program
 
		          #include "filename.h"

  Difference between Standard header file & user header file

		Standard header file =====>  stdio.h
		#include<stdio.h>

		user header file
		#include "filename.h"

==============================================================================


    Linked List :  
		  Collection of nodes

                  Node :  (Self Referntial Structure) 
                          consists of two parts : 1) Data  2) Link / pointer to next           
		
                  data is stored in non contiguous manner


		  Linked list has two pointers : 1) Head : points to the first node

						 2) Tail : points to the last node



    Operations on Linked List 
                   
                  1) Insert node at tail
                  2) Insert a node at Head
                  3) Insert a node between any two nodes of Linked List


    Traversing the list : To access all elements of the list


    Type of Linked List :
			1) Singly 
				Unidirctional ==> traverse elements in a single direction
			2) doubly
				Bidirectional ==> traverse elements in both direction
			3) Circular
				In circular manner List is created , Tail will point to head but not points to NULL

Searching

         To find an element in a data structure like an array.

 Type of Searching :
                    1) Linear / sequential searching

                    2) Binary Search

          Binary search is more efficient than Linear search

Sorting 
        
	To arrange elements in ascending or descending order

	1) Bubble Sort 
	2) Insertion sort


====================================================================================

Non Linear Data Structure

			 
                         1) Tree 
			 2) Graph

 Traversal

                  1) Inorder         (Left -> Root -> Right)


                  2) Preorder        (Root->Left->Right)

                 
                  3) Postorder       (Left->Right->Root)
