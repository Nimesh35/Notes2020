1)  C Programming History

2) Write a c program to find as follows :
     a) a=30 ,b =20 find a/b,   where a and b are float
     b) Program to find the area of circle and rectangle.
     c) Program to print your name with your age.

3) Write a program to calculate the following :
      a= 3.5
      b=2.5
    1)  a2+b2+2ab   
    3)  a2 /b2  
    
4) Write a program to define an integer ,character ,float and double values and print all values along with its size.

5) Create a program to take 2 values from user and print addition, multiplication ,subtraction and division.

6) Take two numbers from user and compare values and print results as false or true.

7) Create two variables , one is integer and other is double and do the operations like multiplication and subtraction on these variable.

8) Write a program to define a function Calculator() which accepts two integer values and print sum,subtraction,division and multiplication.

9) Write a program to define a function which takes a number from user and print the number.

10) Write a program to take a number from user and pass this number to the function named as Square() which returns the square of the number and print square value in main.

11) Write a function which takes a character in small case and returns the same character in capital case.

12) Write a program to display the result acoording to following using only if:
     
       marks < 40        Fail
       40 <= marks <65   Second Division
       65 <= marks < 75  First Division
       75 <= marks       Distinction

       
13) Write a program to find the largest of two numbers given by user.
       
14) Write a program using switch....case , create a function which takes two values as parameters 

    +   ======>  Do Addition of two nos.
    -   ======>  Subtraction
    /   ======>  Division
    *   ======>  Multiplication
    
    Output :
             Enter two nos : 2 3
             Press + to ADD, - to Subtract, / to divide, * to Multiply : +
             Sum of 2 and 3 is : 5
             
15) Write a program to do the following using switch...case

    Read percentage of a student inside a function and check if the percentage lies in the following range and print the Grade accodingle :
    Percentage            Grade
    80<per<=100           A+
    60<per<=80            A
    per<60                Fail
    
    Output :
           Enter your Percentage : 67 
           Percenge : 67 % , Your Grade is : A 
           
 16) Display the following Pattern :
     *
     **
